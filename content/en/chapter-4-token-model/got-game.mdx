# Got Game?

Early on we thought cryptoeconomics could well be explained as the merger of game theory, specifically mechanism design and computer science. Way more specifically, cryptographically secured peer-to-peer protocols, with which value can be exchanged over the Internet. Mechanism design is also called reverse game theory. Instead of a given game, e.g. Prisoner's Dilemma, in which given the circumstances and rules the strategic decision-making of rational agents is mathematically modelled and analyzed, in mechanism design the goal or outcome is given. The designer then is interested in the economic mechanisms, i.e. incentives or the game's structure, that will make rational agents reach the goal.

Most of blockchain protocols are designed or analyzed as [economic games](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/12/28/understanding-serenity-part-2-casper/). However, the basic assumptions in the underlying traditional economics, that is rational agents and well-defined problems, break as soon as we consider more complex coordination problems on top of these blockchain protocols.  For a discussion of tokenization as complex coordination problem refer to [Foundations of Cryptoeconomic Systems](https://epub.wu.ac.at/7309/8/Foundations%20of%20Cryptoeconomic%20Systems.pdf) and [Token Economy](https://github.com/Token-Economy-Book/EnglishOriginal/wiki). For a discussion of assumptions and better economic models refer to [Foundations of complexity economics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-020-00273-3) and [The ergodicity problem in economics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0732-0).

Why we still are interested in games, has very practical reasons. Games are how non-technical participants can understand system dynamics. Games are how technical participants get to appreciate how wonderfully unpredictable, ingenious, players will act, react, and interact with and within the designed game structure. Over half a century ago, gaming was rediscovered, for its same properties we are interested now: as ["The Future's Language"](https://de.slideshare.net/pvdhyden/74duke-gaming-the-futures-language) 
>„the prime purpose of gaming/simulation is to establish dialogue to increase communication among a group about a topic which is complex, future-oriented, of a systems nature, and which requires a vocabulary or vernacular which is not commonly shared by the group at the outset of the discussion.“ 

We rediscovered games in token engineering not only because of its potential for multilogue, experiential learning, and co-creation in participatory networks; but also because the specific game we encountered ["Le Grand Jeu"](https://github.com/freddbomba/legrandjeu/blob/master/doc/legrandjeu.md) had the same game mechanics as the components of [cadCAD](https://github.com/cadCAD-org/cadCAD), the first open sourced computer-aided design library available to token engineers. This connection is explained in more detail in section "Computer-aided Design". For general insights on designing simulation games refer to [Simulation games- a concise introduction to the design process](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264543759_Simulation_games_-_a_concise_introduction_to_the_design_process). For a detailed recount of how to facilitate a simulation game refer to [A practitioner researcher perspective on facilitating an open, infinite, chaordic simulation](https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/2100/308). I particularly like this reference because it gives insights into the same topics and theories of interest in token model generation from the perspective of facilitating simulations games - which seems very much align with the recent insights [on leadership in the 21st century](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vX2iVIJMFQ).

After many iterations of simulation games for token economies, which [started end of 2019](https://medium.com/freeelio-studios/le-grand-jeu-met-token-engineering-and-it-was-love-at-first-sight-e7a85c6d9444), it became obvious that playing games could improve systems thinking. Players see the whole game play out differently than their assumptions about the parts (playing pieces, game rules) would have made them think. This is due to completely different strategies that the other players chose to play or unpredictable reactions to unforseen events. In the [Ecosystem Value Flows courses](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/academy-tmg1-ecosystem/) we get the feedback that even trying to design an ecosystem game, increases the systems thinking fluency. Some participants appreciate for the first time, the power and responsibility we have in designing token economies: we decide whether the games we design and chose to play are win-lose competitive zero-sum games or prosocial cooperative positive-sum games. More aware participants also start to analyze their own thinking in systems, and challenge their own paradigms. This learning opportunity is what systems thinkers have identified as the [highest leverage point in systems thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_leverage_points#1._Power_to_transcend_paradigms): 
>"Transcending paradigms may go beyond challenging fundamental assumptions, into the realm of changing the values and priorities that lead to the assumptions, and being able to choose among value sets at will." 

In 2021, the games we see play out in deployed cryptoeconomic networks are yet very limited. The ones that have been "successful" at scale conform to the [definition of Casino Capitalism](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/casino-capitalism). Hence, the purpose of this section is twofold: (a) encourage participants to challenge and play with the designs of token economies (b) as token engineers to use the templates for co-design and/or co-simulation with participants. We will explain concepts in simulation games in a manner that is directly relateable to computer simulations. As we like to say in the course: 
>If the game is no fun, neither will the computer simulation be insightful.

For how to balance reality, meaning, and play refer to [Triadic Game Design](https://web.northeastern.edu/casperharteveld/tgd/index.html). Remember though: in participatory networks it is more valuable to co-create and play the game for its potential in meaning-making. Maybe in the future we will have more practical advice in how to guide the co-creation and co-simulation such that all participants are involved in this balancing act. [Exploratory analyses in games](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-019-7232-1) show that the actual effort of meaning-making on the side of the player adds to valorization. Such studies reveal the dimensions along which we can understand token economies that have richer value dimensions than exchange price.
