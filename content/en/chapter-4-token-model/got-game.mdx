# Got Game?

Early on we thought cryptoeconomics could well be explained as the merger of game theory, specifically mechanism design and computer science. Way more specifically, cryptographically secured peer-to-peer protocols, with which value can be exchanged over the Internet. Mechanism design is also called reverse game theory. Instead of a given game, e.g. Prisoner's Dilemma, in which given the circumstances and rules the strategic decision-making of rational agents is mathematically modelled and analyzed, in mechanism design the goal or outcome is given. The designer then is interested in the economic mechanisms, i.e. incentives or the game's structure, that will make rational agents reach the goal.

Most of blockchain protocols are designed or analyzed as [economic games](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/12/28/understanding-serenity-part-2-casper/). However, the basic assumptions in the underlying traditional economics, that is rational agents and well-defined problems, break as soon as we consider more complex coordination problems on top of these blockchain protocols.  For a discussion of tokenization as complex coordination problem refer to [Foundations of Cryptoeconomic Systems](https://epub.wu.ac.at/7309/8/Foundations%20of%20Cryptoeconomic%20Systems.pdf) and [Token Economy](https://github.com/Token-Economy-Book/EnglishOriginal/wiki). For a discussion of assumptions and better economic models refer to [Foundations of complexity economics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-020-00273-3) and [The ergodicity problem in economics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0732-0).

Why we still are interested in games, has very practical reasons. Games are how non-technical participants can understand system dynamics. Games are how technical participants get to appreciate how wonderfully unpredictable, ingenious, players will act, react, and interact with and within the designed game structure. Over half a century ago, gaming was rediscovered, for its same properties we are interested now: as ["The Future's Language"](https://de.slideshare.net/pvdhyden/74duke-gaming-the-futures-language) 
>„the prime purpose of gaming/simulation is to establish dialogue to increase communication among a group about a topic which is complex, future-oriented, of a systems nature, and which requires a vocabulary or vernacular which is not commonly shared by the group at the outset of the discussion.“ 

We rediscovered games in token engineering not only because of its potential for multilogue, experiential learning, and co-creation in participatory networks; but also because the specific game we encountered ["Le Grand Jeu"](https://github.com/freddbomba/legrandjeu/blob/master/doc/legrandjeu.md) had the same game mechanics as the components of [cadCAD](https://github.com/cadCAD-org/cadCAD), the first open sourced computer-aided design library available to token engineers. This connection is explained in more detail in section "Computer-aided Design". For general insights on designing simulation games refer to [Simulation games- a concise introduction to the design process](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264543759_Simulation_games_-_a_concise_introduction_to_the_design_process). For a detailed recount of how to facilitate a simulation game refer to [A practitioner researcher perspective on facilitating an open, infinite, chaordic simulation](https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/2100/308). I particularly like this reference because it gives insights into the same topics and theories of interest in token model generation from the perspective of facilitating simulations games - which seems very much align with the recent insights [on leadership in the 21st century](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vX2iVIJMFQ).

After many iterations of simulation games for token economies, which [started end of 2019](https://medium.com/freeelio-studios/le-grand-jeu-met-token-engineering-and-it-was-love-at-first-sight-e7a85c6d9444), it became obvious that playing games could improve systems thinking. Players see the whole game play out differently than their assumptions about the parts (playing pieces, game rules) would have made them think. This is due to completely different strategies that the other players chose to play or unpredictable reactions to unforseen events. In the [Ecosystem Value Flows courses](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/academy-tmg1-ecosystem/) we get the feedback that even trying to design an ecosystem game, increases the systems thinking fluency. Some participants appreciate for the first time, the power and responsibility we have in designing token economies: we decide whether the games we design and chose to play are win-lose competitive zero-sum games or prosocial cooperative positive-sum games. More aware participants also start to analyze their own thinking in systems, and challenge their own paradigms. This learning opportunity is what systems thinkers have identified as the [highest leverage point in systems thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_leverage_points#1._Power_to_transcend_paradigms): 
>"Transcending paradigms may go beyond challenging fundamental assumptions, into the realm of changing the values and priorities that lead to the assumptions, and being able to choose among value sets at will." 

In 2021, the games we see play out in deployed cryptoeconomic networks are yet very limited. The ones that have been "successful" at scale conform to the [definition of Casino Capitalism](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/casino-capitalism). Hence, the purpose of this section is twofold: (a) encourage participants to challenge and play with the designs of token economies (b) as token engineers to use the templates for co-design and/or co-simulation with participants. We will explain concepts in simulation games in a manner that is directly relateable to computer simulations. As we like to say in the course: 
>If the game is no fun, neither will the computer simulation be insightful.

For how to balance reality, meaning, and play refer to [Triadic Game Design](https://web.northeastern.edu/casperharteveld/tgd/index.html). Remember though: in participatory networks it is more valuable to co-create and play the game for its potential in meaning-making for each participant, reaching a common sense and shared vision. [Exploratory analyses in games](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-019-7232-1) show that the actual effort of meaning-making on the side of the player adds to valorization of the game space. Such studies reveal the attributes along which we can understand token economies that have richer value dimensions than exchange price. Hence, you can choose to use the provided templates in the same way like [Design Thinking](https://thecanvasrevolution.com/product-category/design-thinking) or [Business Model Generation](https://canvanizer.com/new/business-model-canvas) canvases for ideating and documenting your key assumptions. Or you can invite participants to own their own assumptions and play their part in co-creating and co-simulating the token economy. In comparison you will see the shortcomings of the established ways of formulating and validating assumptions when it comes to token model. The game metaphor in the following is both playful and helpful demonstrating the wholistic, participatory, and experiential aspect token model generation, which goes beyond algorithmic policy-making by a few token engineers. In token model generation we give practical advice in how to facilitate the co-creation and co-simulation such that all participants are involved in this balancing act. 

## What constitutes a good game?
In a hitchhiker's style we browsed the internet and exchanged with gamers what constitutes a good game. Not for the sake of teaching game design, but in search for what we can learn from game design to make gathering of information for modeling and simulation of a token economy as enjoyable and as participatory as possible. There is a myriad of sources and theories especially with respect to the meaning-making, sense-making, as well as experiential and social learning aspects of games, which are very much relevant to token economies. In token engineering, we can make use of models in the "Psychology and Decision Science" petal of the [cryptoeconomics flower](_add link - coudl display image in tooltip_].

Defining characteristics of a game are said to be having a goal, rules, a feedback system. For a deep dive refer to [Reality is broken: How games make us better and how they can change the world](https://janemcgonigal.com/play-me/). "Ability to win" is not the defining characteristic of a game, especially in simulation games. This is also well explained in ["Infinite Games"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinite_Game). Whether we are cooperative or competitive and what the game should foster may be open design questions. We know that humans are extraordinarily cooperative. It is empirically shown how [cooperation evolved as a competitive strategy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14416-8). When we design policies it is very interesting to look for positive sum games, and consciously choose these over win-lose zero-sum games. We will also look into motivations of players. Eypecially when we design incentive mechanisms, we must not ignore the detrimental effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation. In practice, things that must be done or are repetitive can be incentivized by the act of gamification. We cannot ignore that overly competitive simplistic zero-sum games such as Monopoly leave no space for any of these alternatives. In one of our case studies, [The Invisible Economy](https://powerdada.medium.com/the-invisible-economy-db46897d4f07), we follow the primacy of intrinsic motivations. The assumption is that for any action that is needed by the collective there is an individual who will act out of pure intrinsic motivation no matter the nature of the task. Leaping a bit into the future, we see that all repetitive tasks can be automated and that intrinsically motivated participants create prosocial positive-sum games.

A good game has a consistent narrative that inspires the players. A good briefing of the narrative in early game design should capture the motivation and trigger the imagination of "early players" to help fil in the gaps. The storyline should incorporate dilemmas and surprises such that players must make meaningful decisions and take actions that generate insights. Most valuable are insights into player's reasoning and motivations, which will inform the useful incentive mechanism design. Surprises ensure that we see the differences in policies play out dynamically. Where computer simulations can help us see unintended consequences of policies over time and under changing conditions, game simulations help us see how players' policies can change and change the game.

In the following we will walk through these components of a good game, but adapt names and sometimes extend definitions or just compare to what we will need in computer simulations. For example, in modeling and simulation we are interested in "what are we optimizing for?" and ["objective functions"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization). We are touching upon a few of the Chaordic Organization components, which informs token model generation practice: "Purpose, Principle, People" already in this section. In the next section of this Chapter, "Ecosystem Value Flows", we will transform the information gathered here using the templates into adapted stock and flow diagrams to create a common perspective between domain/business and engineering. These are valueflow diagrams help us reason about sustainability using domain specifics as well as dynamic models using one common visual language. This conceptual model of the token economy corresponds with "Concept" in Chaordic Organizations. In final sections "Computer-aided Design" and "Experiment-driven Development" we then venture into the technical and techno-organizational aspects of token model generation, wich correspond to "Structure and Practice"

### Purpose, Principles, Goals, Objectives
Principles are the foundation of our belief systems, behaviors, and our reasoning. Principles frame the way in which we set or want to attain goals, our aspirations. Principles guide us, help us name our values. Even if we have never explicitely named them we live by them. On the other hand we might explicitely state principles and values, yet act in opposing directions. That is called [value-action gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-action_gap) and is quite apparent with environmental concerns or social justice. 

### Participants, Motivations, Playing Pieces

### Policies - or Rules of the Game and Players' Strategies

### Insights lead to Meaning-Making, Sense-Making, Decision-Making

## Games as co-design and co-simulations
refers to blueprint for design of verifiable simulation models
when we co-design we start with co-creating and developing the narrative, playing out existing policies and challenging.
