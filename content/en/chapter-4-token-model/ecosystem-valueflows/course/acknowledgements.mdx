The Ecosystem Game exercises use [Le Grand Jeu](http://legrandjeu.net/?page_id=70) as an inspiration for participants. The way we incorporate them are a result of [many hours of playtesting games](https://medium.com/freeelio-studios/le-grand-jeu-met-token-engineering-and-it-was-love-at-first-sight-e7a85c6d9444) with Federico Bonelli and Raffaella Rovida. The inspiration can lead to ideas for co-creating, co-designing, or simply explaining the token economy in more accessible ways to more of the participants. 

The canvases are inspired by Ville Elorante’s “ideology-free design toolkit for digital [ecosystem design](https://github.com/villeeloranta/ecosystem-design-toolkit).” It was the simplifications and generalizations that helped us make [connections with cadCAD modeling structures](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JnWZwXP7UhkpGQA4Md3IkJgiu84Xmvb4uxh0f1-cVz4/edit#slide=id.g5ebee69bd6_0_7). The addition of the governance canvas based on Elinor Ostrom's principles for commons management were helpful in asking the right questions. Yet as we explore later in TMG1 Practice & Governance, permissionless participation requires participants to do their own research and token engineers to enable informed participation. It is a [progressive process](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/) that you apply around a minimally viable dApp. This is the focus in part two of token model generation TMG2 Experiment-driven Design, Development and Deployment.

Ville's work itself is derived from [Platform Design Toolkit]( www.platformdesigntoolkit.com) by Boundaryless Srl, which incorporates more elements of Design Thinking and Business Model Generation by Strategizer AG. We focus solely on motivations and interactions, since this is where incentive mechanism design in participatory, collaborative networks of value will apply. We recommend using stakeholder portraits and stories in as much detail as possible so that you get a sense of how well you know the participants and network of value. Otherwise, these canvases help you identify questions and how and where to ask them to potential participants. 

Originally, the Stakeholder Profile is inspired by the [Ecosystem Entity-Role Portrait](https://stories.platformdesigntoolkit.com/evolving-user-research-into-the-age-of-platforms-ecosystems-9ca549f81d76). As the article explains, the profile was developed on the basis of Xplane [Empathy Map](https://xplane.com/worksheets/empathy-map-worksheet/) and Strategyzer AG Value Proposition Canvas and [John Hagel III’s](https://johnhagel.medium.com/) work. However, if your token economy is only or mostly built around extrinsic motivations, mutual exchanges, or financial flows then Ville's [Ecosystem Member Profiles](https://github.com/villeeloranta/ecosystem-design-toolkit/blob/master/aalto_ecosystemdesigntoolkit_v01jan20_200122v1_ve.pdf) ar the right level of abstraction. The Motivation Matrix is inspired by previous work by [Ezio Manzini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezio_Manzini).

Without these contributions our efforts to find an easy but suitable onboarding to Token Engineering would have taken much longer. In preparation of this compilation for the course “Ecosystem Value Flows”, we found that motivations of ecosystem stakeholders matters more than our assumptions about those. We developed “Stakeholder Stories” using storyboarding as a way to ideate and document ecosystem dynamics that emerge through actions and the motivations behind those actions, as well as desired outcomes and defined policies. Many thanks to Angela Kreitenweis, the initiator of [Token Engineering Academy](https://tokenengineering.org) for sparring on these new storyboard elements and the course. Michal Monit the co-host of the Ecosystem Valufe Flows Course has crafted the canvases and course materials' look and feel. Based on his extensive experience with [ExO](https://www.exo.works/faq/what-is-a-massive-transformative-purpose-mtp), Michal contributed canvases to help wordsmith Ecosystem's Purpose, Principles as well as Paticipants. 

The Value Network Specification uses the adapted stock & flow notation developed by Dr. Michael Zargham at [BlockScience](https://block.science/) for cadCAD. [Computer-aided Design for Complex Dynamic Systems](https://cadcad.org/) is part of TMG2. We recommend the Bootcamp and cadCAD Hacks for practitioners by cadCAD Edu. In essence, the entire Ecosystem Value Flows course aims creating a system and conceptual model of the token network, which then can be simulated and improved with cadCAD. 

Ecosystem Value Flows is a subsection taken from the “Token Model Generation” Chapter of the crowdsourced and crowdfunded book “A Hitchhiker’s Guide to Token Engineering.” In the chapter, we also make references to Dee Hock's [Charodic Organizations](https://thesystemsthinker.com/the-nature-and-creation-of-chaordic-organizations/): Purpose, Principle, People, Concept, Structure, Practice is a simple thread which holds the iterations of design together.
